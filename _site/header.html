            <h1>Hello, I'm <span>Sophia!</span></h1>
            <p>
                I am pursuing my M.Sci. in Software Engineering at Stevens Institute of Technology. I graduated with my <a href="#">B.E. Software Engineering</a> and a minor in Information Systems in May 2024. I have interest in web and app development, as well as data analytics. My favorite project has been <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-43950-6_4">Software Development Research Assistant</a>. I am looking for full-time opportunities in any field!
            </p>

                <p>I can't say too much on this one due to an NDA. But as a small snippit, I contributed to the development of a Python-based tool designed to enhance decision-making processes by implementing a prompt generation mechanism and addressing integration challenges with OpenAI's capabilities. By integrating GPT-4, I advanced the tool's functionality to include text extraction from PDFs and the generation of key points and prompts. Additionally, I created a React site featuring a wheel graphic and a MongoDB backend to support the tool's operations.</p>

                <p>Check it out <a href =https://monkfish-app-7swuc.ondigitalocean.app>here</a>! I led the development of the software component for the SmartSecure project, a door lock system utilizing NFC technology for user authentication. Designed and implemented an Android companion app with Java, Android navigation components, and UI elements to enhance user interaction. Created intuitive features including a navigation drawer with toggle functionality, dynamic lock status display, and Google Firebase-based user authentication.</p>

                <p>I led data collection and analysis on over 400 minutes of audio data using Excel to support the creation of an IoT model for automating smart devices to detect user movement. I developed several Android Studio apps with features like geofencing, light sensing, and location tracking, focusing on user-friendly interfaces. Additionally, I designed and built a website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and PHP for the research organization, incorporating an admin dashboard to streamline data entry into a SQL database, enabling live updates to the site.
