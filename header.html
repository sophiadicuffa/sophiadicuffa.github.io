            <h1>Hello, I'm <span>Sophia!</span></h1>
            <p>
                I am pursuing my M.Sci. in Software Engineering at Stevens Institute of Technology. I graduated with my <a href="#">B.E. Software Engineering</a> and a minor in Information Systems in May 2024. I have interest in web and app development, as well as data analytics. My favorite project has been <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-43950-6_4">Software Development Research Assistant</a>. I am looking for full-time opportunities in any field!
            </p>

                <p>I can't say too much on this one due to an NDA. But as a small snippet, I created a React.js website with an interactive SVG wheel, all connected to a MongoDB backend. I added a feature where you can upload PDFs and then use AI (OpenAI and Python) to generate summaries and save them to the database. I made the wheel clickable so users can view more details for each section. I also fine-tuned a ChatGPT model to grasp the relationships between different categories and wrote Python scripts to help the AI identify question categories based on keywords.</p>

                <p>Check it out <a href =https://monkfish-app-7swuc.ondigitalocean.app>here</a>! I was the lead software engineer for the SmartSecure project, a door lock system utilizing NFC technology for user authentication. I designed and implemented an Android Studios app with Java, Android navigation components, and UI elements to enhance user interaction. My app included intuitive features like a navigation drawer with toggle functionality, dynamic lock status display, and Google Firebase-based user authentication. I enjoyed working with mechanical engineers on this project!</p>

                <p>My work contributed to the publication you can read <a href =#>here</a>! I led data collection and analysis on over 400 minutes of audio data using Excel to support the creation of an IoT model for automating smart devices to detect user movement. I developed several Android Studio apps with features like geofencing, light sensing, and location tracking, focusing on user-friendly interfaces. Additionally, I designed and built a website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and PHP for the research organization, incorporating an admin dashboard to streamline data entry into a SQL database, enabling live updates to the site. </p>
